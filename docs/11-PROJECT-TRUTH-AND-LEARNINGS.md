# 11 — Project Truth, Learnings, and the Evidence Ladder

> Added in v1.2.0. Distilled from three further months of running the framework on a production
> codebase with many parallel agent sessions. Everything here is tech-stack and domain agnostic, and
> nothing in it depends on a Copilot surface — it applies to the cloud agent, IDE chat, and the CLI
> alike.

The v1.0 framework answered *"who does the work and how do they talk to each other?"* (agents,
handoff schema, instruction files). Three months of real use exposed the next failure class: **a
fresh agent with no transcript knows only what is in git — and git mostly recorded *code*, not
*truth*.**

Symptoms, all observed more than once:

- An agent built a feature that already existed, because nothing said "this exists, it is just
  hidden behind a flag".
- An agent treated a staging-only feature as live in production, because the orientation map
  described the feature but not *where it was deployed*.
- A "we'll do that later" spoken at the end of a session vanished, and was re-discovered as a bug
  two weeks on.
- An instruction file documented the wrong HTTP verb for a route. Three agents trusted it. The
  fourth read the route.

The fix is three more documents, one playbook, and one enforced habit. This chapter specifies them.

## The three knowledge stores (and what goes where)

| Store | File | Answers | Written by | Loaded |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Project truth** | `docs/ai-context/PROJECT.md` | *What is true right now?* Environments, what is live where, sources of truth per domain, verified commands, definitions of done | Humans + agents, on every state change | Read at the start of every substantial task |
| **Learnings** | `docs/ai-context/LEARNINGS.md` | *What did we decide, what failed, what keeps going wrong, how has the owner corrected us?* | Agents, same turn a lesson emerges | Skim §D (corrections) before the first edit |
| **Backlogs** | `docs/<AREA>_BACKLOG.md` | *What did we defer, and when should we come back?* | Agents, before any turn that names deferred work ends | On "what's pending on X?" |

These sit alongside the stores v1.0 already had: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (router —
or `AGENTS.md` if the project wants the router read by more than one AI tool),
`.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` (path-scoped hard rules, `applyTo:`),
`docs/ai-context/<area>.md` (orientation), `docs/<UPPERCASE>.md` (canonical reference), and any
IDE- or CLI-local memory the tool keeps (not visible to teammates).

**One home per fact.** Every other place links to it. When the same rule turns up in two files,
consolidate and leave a pointer. The single most corrosive doc smell is two copies that drift.

### Where a new piece of knowledge goes

| Kind of knowledge | Home |
|---|---|
| Universal behaviour + routing | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (keep under ~200 lines) |
| Current state — what is live where, flags, applied migrations | `PROJECT.md` §3 + `docs/CHANGELOG.md` |
| A decision and its rationale | `LEARNINGS.md` §A |
| An approach that failed or proved unsafe | `LEARNINGS.md` §B |
| A recurring bug: symptom → first thing to check | `LEARNINGS.md` §C |
| A correction the owner had to give more than once | `LEARNINGS.md` §D **and** an instruction file if path-scoped |
| A hard rule scoped to file paths | `.github/instructions/<domain>.instructions.md` (`applyTo:`) |
| Per-area orientation (50–150 lines) | `docs/ai-context/<area>.md` |
| Deferred work | `docs/<AREA>_BACKLOG.md` |
| A multi-step repeatable procedure | `.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| Machine-private session pointers | Any IDE- or CLI-local memory the tool keeps — **not** visible to teammates or other agents; anything durable must *also* land in one of the above |

**Don't persist:** session-specific context, one-off data values, anything derivable from code or
git in seconds, generic engineering advice.

## `PROJECT.md` — the freshness contract

Template: `templates/PROJECT.md.template`. The sections that earn their keep:

1. **Product + roles** — one paragraph and a table of roles with their permission boundaries.
2. **Environments, branches, deploy** — and, critically, **what the deploy pipeline does NOT do**
   (migrations, cache purges, config pushes). "Migrations don't auto-apply" cost a real outage.
3. **Current state — what is live where.** A table: feature → prod / staging / flag / date. This is
   the single biggest fresh-agent trap: most recent work is usually staging-only and flag-gated.
4. **Repository map** — verified, date-stamped.
5. **Sources of truth by domain** — the canonical helper / table / module for each concept, so an
   agent reuses instead of re-implementing.
6. **Verified commands** — copied from the real build/test config, with the date.
7. **Definitions of done per change type.**
8. **Known sharp edges + unverified items.**

**The contract:** every fact is date-stamped, and the header names the commit it was verified
against. If today is much later than the stamp, trust `docs/CHANGELOG.md` over the state table,
*then fix the table*. A state claim without a date becomes a lie the day after it stops being true.

## `LEARNINGS.md` — decisions, failures, corrections

Template: `templates/LEARNINGS.md.template`. Six sections:

- **A. Decision records** — what was decided, by whom, why, dated.
- **B. Failed or unsafe approaches** — so nobody re-tries them. Each entry: what was tried, what
  broke, what replaced it.
- **C. Recurring bug patterns** — symptom → first thing to check. The cheapest section to write and
  the one that saves the most hours.
- **D. Agent behaviour corrections** — written as *"Instead of: … / Do: …"* pairs. These came from
  real corrections; treat them as standing instructions.
- **E. Working with the project owner** — the owner's preferred formats and approval gates.
  Examples that generalise: *multi-item status = a table, not prose*; *open decisions = one numbered
  list, resolved one at a time, never drop an item*; *approval is per-incident and current-turn,
  never carried forward from an earlier session*.
- **F. Documentation maintenance protocol** — the "where does knowledge go" table above, plus:
  date-stamp state claims; prune on contact (a verified-stale entry is fixed or deleted in the same
  turn, never left); unresolved conflicts get a ⚠ CONFLICT flag for the owner, never a silent pick.

Where a lesson is already a hard rule, `LEARNINGS.md` carries one line and a pointer — never a copy.

---

## Backlogs — deferred work must be written, not spoken

If an end-of-turn summary names *any* "we'll do this later", follow-up PR, known gap, or deferred
phase, the agent **must** append it to `docs/<AREA>_BACKLOG.md` before the turn ends.
Template: `templates/BACKLOG.md.template`. Each entry needs:

```markdown
### <Short title>
- **Why.** (one sentence on user value or technical reason)
- **Effort.** (days/weeks)
- **Where.** (file paths or component names if known)
- **Revisit when.** (the condition or signal to look for)
```

When done, prepend `✓ DONE — PR #N (date)` to the title and leave the body in place for context.

Two corollaries learned the hard way:

- **A backlog card is a claim, not evidence.** "Done" on a card proves nothing about production;
  verify state in `PROJECT.md` §3 or the deployed system.
- **Backlog ids collide across concurrent sessions.** Before taking the next `AREA-N` id (or the
  next migration number), check the remote *and* other open PRs. Two sessions took the same number
  on the same day, twice.

---

## Every production push freshens the docs — same turn, no exceptions

The moment a change lands on the production branch, a future agent sees only what is in git. So a
production push must be paired, **in the same turn**, with updates to the full doc set for what
shipped:

1. `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — the mandatory anchor (a release entry).
2. The affected `docs/ai-context/<area>.md` orientation map(s).
3. Any affected `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` hard rules.
4. `PROJECT.md` §3 if the production *state* changed (new live feature, flag flip, migration applied).

Documentation discipline alone skipped this under deadline pressure roughly one push in five. It is
now an `agentStop` hook (Chapter 10, Pattern 5 — `docs/10-MECHANICAL-ENFORCEMENT.md`) which refuses
to end a turn in which a production push happened and `docs/CHANGELOG.md` was not touched
afterwards. Teams without hooks encode the same list in the orchestrator's Definition of Done and
in the `/commit-push-pr`-style prompt or skill.

## The engineering playbook — six gates and the evidence ladder

Template: `templates/engineering-playbook-skill.md.template`, installed as an Agent Skill at
`.github/skills/<project-slug>-engineering/SKILL.md`. A project-wide skill that every substantial
task runs through; the per-task-type skills (investigate-bug, build-feature) encode the checklists,
this one encodes the gates they share. **If a gate conflicts with a hard rule, the rule wins.**

| Gate | What it forces |
|---|---|
| 1 Scope | Restate the user-visible outcome; classify (bug / extension / pivot / data correction / migration / ops / docs); name affected roles and blast radius; say what is *out* of scope |
| 2 Evidence | Read the minimum routed context; **audit what exists before building** (already supported / supported-but-broken / partial / not supported / not needed); trace the real read/write path; tag every claim with a confidence class |
| 3 Design challenge | Smallest viable change + one rejected alternative; find the existing pattern to mirror; state the failure condition; run the standing impact list (permissions, sensitive data, every client, accessibility, rollout compatibility, flag gating, money paths) |
| 4 Implement | Narrow diffs; new user-visible behaviour lands flag-gated default-off; tests at the right level; code + migrations + scripts + docs in the same change |
| 5 Verify | The evidence ladder below — a green build is evidence, not proof |
| 6 Report | Files, instruction files read, checks run **with actual results**, risks and what was *not* verified (with its confidence class), docs updated, follow-ups written to a backlog |

### The evidence-confidence taxonomy

Mandatory in plans and reports. Nothing below `verified-*` may silently become a premise.

| Class | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `verified-code` / `verified-schema` / `verified-test` / `verified-git` | You looked at the thing itself |
| `documented-unverified` | A doc says so — including *this project's own instruction files* — and you didn't check |
| `historical` | True at a past date; may be stale |
| `unknown` | Needs confirmation |

### The proof ladder (in order of authority)

1. **The user-visible flow, exercised** — drive the real screen, capture the result. UI claims need
   UI proof, never code-reading. Hard-to-reach states are *created* (test accounts, seeds), not
   skipped.
2. **The data, landed** — query for the rows the change was supposed to produce. Proxy signals
   ("queued", "in scope", "deployed", "nothing to do") prove nothing.
3. **The third party, confirmed** — if an external service is involved, check its dashboard or API,
   not your code's return value.
4. **Regression edges** — adjacent tests, permission boundaries, empty/error/loading states, *both*
   sides of any two-sided flow.

Two rules that belong to the ladder:

- **Verify by reading the row, not by reasoning.** Two confident mechanisms were predicted for one
  write; both were wrong; a single query settled it in seconds.
- **Never report a negative result from a reader you have not verified can see the whole set.**
  Default pagination caps (ORMs, REST layers, search APIs) silently truncate. A "none found" from a
  truncating reader is not evidence — check the reader's ceiling first.

---

## Multi-client parity (when more than one client consumes one backend)

A second client is an unusually good audit of the first, and the source of a whole class of drift.
These rules are generic to any web + mobile, or any two consumers of one API, and they are what
makes Chapter 12's cross-repo contracts workable:

- **One client is the functional source of truth; the others may differ in presentation only.**
  What a person can *see and do* may not differ between clients. Layout, density, device affordances
  may. A deliberate divergence is written down with its reason.
- **Same heading ⇒ same endpoint.** Before building a panel that mirrors another client's panel,
  open that client's component and find what it actually *fetches*. Two cards with the same title
  and the same chart fed from two different endpoints showed one user two different answers to one
  question. Record the panel → source pairing in the orientation map.
- **One brain.** Business logic lives server-side; clients render. If a client needs derived data
  another client computes locally, extend the API rather than porting the computation.
- **Changing a contract? Grep every consumer in the same turn.** Clients pin response shapes; a
  renamed field fails silently at runtime (fetch succeeds, screen is empty). Keep a **mirror
  registry** — a table of code deliberately duplicated across clients (palette, label mappers,
  status derivations) — and change both sides in one PR.
- **Never ship a client that hard-depends on a brand-new server route.** Clients and servers deploy
  on different clocks, and an installed client can be older *or newer* than the server. Probe or
  degrade, and say so on screen when degraded.

---

## Smaller lessons that earned a line

- **Search before building.** Grep for the feature first. An existing implementation was rebuilt
  because nothing advertised it — and a "hide until ready" guard had silently removed it for a
  week. Guards that hide features need a visible "hidden because" signal somewhere.
- **Diagnostic scaffolding is removed in the same change as the fix.** An on-screen error line
  that cracked a bug becomes a permanent leak of raw technical text if left in.
- **Two words for one thing ships bugs.** Ambiguous vocabulary (the same word meaning two things in
  two subsystems) caused a silent filter miss in production. Keep a glossary in
  `docs/ai-context/GLOSSARY.md`; adding a fifth name for an existing concept is a defect, not style.
- **Corrections harden into instruction files, never into "I'll remember".** Any memory the IDE or
  CLI keeps is machine-local and invisible to every other agent and teammate.
